          <h3> 101 </h3>
          <p> Starting with the binary digit five, a repetitive pattern forms as it oscillates between different configurations within a stationary conatiner. This pattern is an oscillator, meaning it oscillates between two or more states as the generations progress. The state was found by Achim Flammenkamp in 1994. </p>

          <h3> 119P4H1V0 </h3>
          <p> A spaceship and one of the first of its kind to be discovered; it is a c/4 orthogonal spaceship, categorized for its fast traversal (equivalent to one fourth of the speed of light). It is a glider-like object that traverses, in this case leftward, horizontally across the canvas. The state was found by Dean Hickerson in 1989. </p>

          <h3> 1-2-3-4 </h3>
          <p> Another spaceship, however, it is unlike the rest as it is stationary. The spaceship does not traverse the canvas, but there is an oscillating pattern inside of the spaceship, which resembles a sort of power generator. The origin is unkown. </p>

          <p> The first c/5 diagonal (equivalent to one fifth of the speed of light) spaceship to be discovered. It traverses the canvas relatively quick in a diagonal direction. The state was found by Jason Summers in 2000. </p>

          <h3> 4g-to-5g Reaction </h3>
          <p> Starting wih four gliders near edges of the grid, they traverse the canvas until collision near the center in which it cleanly produces five gliders after the reaction. The state was found bu Dieter Leithner in 1992. </p>

          <h3> 60P312 </h3>
          <p> A period-312 oscillator that generates a very energetic symmetric pattern. Although it is symmetric, the pattern is rather diverse as it generates gliders that move diagonally (in alternating direction) across a fixed container that encapsulates the pattern. The state was found by Dave Greene in 2004.    </p>

          <h3> AK94 gun </h3>
          <p> In accordance to the name, this state produces an automatic weapon-like simulation. It is the smallest AK47 reaction. Multiple clusters of cells define a border that contains a reaction within the conatiner. After the reaction, a standard glider is projected diagonally out of an opening in the container. The state was found by Mike Playle in 2013. </p>

          <h3> Trigger </h3>
          <p> A trigger is a signal, usually a single glider, that collides with a seed constellation to produce a relatively rare still life, oscillator, or some other signal. For this state, a pair of trigger gliders strike a dirty seed constellation which upon imact, creates a reaction that forms mutliple growing clusters. The state was found by Chris Cain in 2015.  </p>

          <h3> Snail </h3>
          <p> Rather ironically, the snail state is the first known c/5 spaceship (equivalent to one fifth of the speed of light). The name comes from the shape of the spaceship as the structure resembles a snail, and it traverses (head first) horizontally across the canvas.   </p>

          <h3> Tubstretcher </h3>
          <p> Categorized as a wickstretcher, that of which a wick is two diagonal lines of cells forming a tub, barge, or similar objects. In this state, the object ignites (projects) a quarter diagonally, which is the smallest known c/4 spaceship (25-cell minimum population) other than the glider found by Jason Summers in 2000. The wick continuously re-ignites, leaving behind a wick trail as it projects the quarter. The state was found by Nicolay Beluchenko in 2005.   </p>
