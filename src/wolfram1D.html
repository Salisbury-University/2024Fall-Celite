        <h2> About Wolfram's Nearest Neighbor 1D Simulator </h2>
        <h3> Background </h3>
        <p>
          This simulator was developed to explore Stephen Wolfram's work on 1-dimensional cellular automata, in
          particular,
          his Nearest Neighbor rules that use simple computational systems to produce complex emegergent behaviors.
          Stephan Wolfram,
          born August 29, 1959 is a highly regarded computer scientist, mathematician, and entrepreneur, and also the
          founder and CEO
          of Wolfram research, the company behind Mathematica, Wolfram|Alpha, and other compuational tools. Wolfram's
          Nearest Neighbor
          refers to how each cell in a 1-dimensional array interatcs with its adjacent neighbors based on certain rules.
          In a
          1-dimensional cellular automata, there is a row of cells, each of which can be in one of a finite number of
          states. At each
          time step, the state of each cell evolves according to a rule based on its current state and the states of its
          neighboring cells.
        </p>
        <h3> Purpose </h3>
        <p>
          The study of 1-dimensional cellular automata, particularly nearest neighbor interactions, has the following
          purposes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Understanding Emergent Behavior
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              One of the primary purposes is to understand how complex patterns and behavior emerge from simple local
              interactions. By studying
              how individual cells in a cellular automata interact with their nearest neighbors, researchers can uncover
              fundamental principles
              of self-organization and emergent phenomena. Beyond mathematics and computer science, this has wide-ranging
              applications in fields
              such as biology, physics, sociology, and economics.

            <li>
              Stephen Wolfram's research in this area has demonstrated that even simple cellular automata rules can
              exhibit computational
              universality, meaning they can perform any computation that a Turing machine can compute. A Turing machine
              is a theoretical
              mathematical model of computation proposed by Alan Turing in 1936. It consists of an infinite tape divided
              into cells, each capable
              of storing a symbol (such as 0 or 1) and a read/write head that can move left or right along the tape. The
              machine operates based on
              a finite set of states and transition rules. Based on the current state, the machine can perform three
              actions: write a symbol, move
              the head, and transition to a new state. Turing machines serve as a theoretical model of computation because
              they can simulate any
              algorithmic process, prove theorems about computability and complexity, and provide a foundation for
              understanding the limits and
              capabilities of algorithms. Overall, Wolfram's insight has profound implications for theoretical computer
              science and the nature of computation.

              Cellular automata, in this case 1-dimensional simulations, serve as excellent educational tools for teaching
              complex systems and computational
              thinking. They provide a tangible way for students to explore concepts such as pattern formation, rule-based
              systems, and emergent behavior. By
              experimenting with different rules and initial conditions, students can gain intuitive insights into how
              simple rules can lead to complex outcomes.
              Wolfram's Nearest Neighbor is especially useful because of its simplicity as a 1-dimensional simulation that
              only considers adjacent neighbors, yet
              it produces a large variation of complex systems, many which resemble the pattern of Pascal's Triangle.

            <li>
              Researchers use cellular automata as models for studying various phenomena, such as pattern formation,
              biological processes, and physical systems.
              The simplicity of the rules and the ability to simulate large-scale systems make cellular automata valuable
              tools for exploring theoretical questions
              and generating hypotheses for further study. In particular, Wolfram's Nearest Neighbor predominantly aids
              mathematical and computational studies,
              however, it has some applications in applicable biological research and analysis of physical systems.

              While cellular automata are not inherently mathematical objects, they provide insights into mathematical
              concepts such as chaos theory, fractals,
              and computational complexity. Studying the behavior of cellular automata can lead to new mathematical
              insights and conjectures, particularly in the
              realm of dynamical systems and discrete mathematics. specifically, Wolfram's Nearest Neighbor provides
              insight into pattern recognition, dimensionality
              reduction of the data while preserving its local and global structure, cluster analysis (partitioned data
              points into groups based on their similarity
              or proximity), data interpolation and extrapolation (missing or incomplete data points are estimated based
              on the nearest neighbors), and topological
              analysis (topological properties of the space: connectivity, compactness, and dimensionality). Ultimately,
              Wolfram's Nearest Neighbor provides immense
              mathematical insight through its vast applications in data analitics, data categorization, continuity, and
              predictions.

        <h3> Summary </h3>
        <p>
          In the context of cellular automaton, the Nearest Neighbor algorithm can be applied to determine the state
          transition
          rules for each cell based on the states of its neighboring cells in the lattice. A cell, in mathematics, is a
          basic unit
          within a lattice, or rather, a rectangular grid consisting of discrete cells arranged in rows and columns,
          forming a
          multi-dimensional grid that acts as a spatial framework for cellular automaton evolution. Each cell typically
          has a finite number of possible states, and the evolution of the cellular automaton is determined by rules
          that govern cell state change over time by using neighboring cell states. A cell state specifically refers to
          the
          condition or value associated with a cell within a cellular automaton, commonly represented in binary states
          (dead/alive),
          which is used for this simulation. The grid structure allows for the simulation of dynamic systems and the
          emergence of
          complex behaviors from simple local rules, in this case, rules 0-255 (2^8 rules). The rules change how the
          neighboring cells
          (left and right) determine the next cell state. The simulation can be completed with varying rule sets, lattice
          sizes, and
          iterations and and each alteration will produce a unique result. Additionally, the Nearest Neighbor algorithm
          can be done with
          a finite or infinite lattice, such that an infinite lattice is unbounded in respect to neighbors where out of
          bound neighbors
          are 0 and become bounded, and a finite lattice must be handled with null boundaries (cells outside of the
          lattice bounds have
          no influence on the evolution of the system) or periodic boundaries (edges of the lattice wrap around to connect
          with the opposite edge).
          Overall, cellular automaton are discrete computational models composed of a grid of cells that iteratively
          evolve using a set mathematical rule.
