          <u>Infinite</u>: The lattice is conceptually, and in this simulation, visibly extended infinitely in horizontal direction. Upon iteration, the lattice expands to the left and right side in order to simulate an infinitely sized lattice, as in, a lattice with infinite dead cells (white, 0). Since a cells state depends on its left and right neighbor, the infinite simulation expands on the edges per iteration so that the edge cells always have a left and right neighbor.

        <div class="p3"> 
          <u>Finite</u>: The lattice has a fixed size such that the cells at the edges of the lattice do not have neighbors beyond the boundaries. Therefore, there must be a method to handle the edge cells such as a periodic or null boundary conditions. 
        </div>
        <div class="p4"> 
          <i> Periodic: </i> The lattice is treated as if it were wrapped around, forming a torus-like shape. When a cell reaches the edge of the lattice, its neighbors on the opposite side of the lattice are considered as its direct neighbors. This creates a seamless continuity in the behavior as if the lattice repeats itself indefinitely. <br>
          <i> Null: </i> Imposes a fixed value zero for cells beyond the edges of the lattice. Thus, every edge cell with an out of bounds neighbor considers the neighbor to be dead (white, 0) and will use it in the next cell state calculation. This effectively creates a "wall" at the edges of the lattice.

        <div class="p3"> 
          <u>General Description</u>: The canvas is the gray region enclosed by a black border below the primary and secondary toolbars. It has a fixed width and a dynamic height. Changing the lattice size will not impact the width of the canvas. Rather, cells will be added until they reach the edge of the canvas, then the cells will be evenly resized to fit the fixed canvas width. As for the height, the canvas will dynamically extend downard as space is needed (as iterations occur). Upon using the "Iterate" button, the canvas will seemingly expand and simulate in the same instance, but using the "Start" will show a slower expansion prioir to the simulation.

          <u>Cell State Toggle</u>: While inside the canvas, clicking cells will toggle them between dead (white, 0) and alive (balck, 1) states to set a starting position (index = 0) for the simulation. Only the starting state cells can be toggled. Cells can be toggled even if a simulation has already completed; clicking "Start" or "Iterate" will overwrite the canvas. Cell borders will automatically be removed on the starting lattice for lattice sizes over 200.

        <div class="p3"> 
          <u>Zoom</u>: While inside the canvas, using the scroll wheel on a mouse will zoom on a specified location. The x-axis mouse location determines the horizontal zoom focus and the y-axis mouse location determines the vertical zoom focus. When only the starting iteration is present on the canvas (index = 0), the y-axis mouse location has no impact on the zoom focus location; the vertical zoom focus, in this case, will always be on the starting lattice in the canvas. Scroll up to zoom in and scroll down to zoom out. The maximum outward zoom is set to the default zoom factor for the canvas.

        <div class="p4"> 
          <i> Warning: </i> The zoom feature encounters performance issues with large lattice sizes and iteration amounts.

        <h6 id="WNNalgorithm"> Algorithm Rule </h6>
        <div class="p3"> 
          The Wolfram Nearest Neighbor algorithm works by updating the state of each cell, which can either be dead (0) or alive (1), in a one-dimensional lattice based on the state of that cell and its immediate neighbors (left and right). For each cell in the lattice, we consider it together with its left and right neighbors as a triplet. For example, if the left cell is 1, the current cell is 0, and the right cell is 1, the triplet is 101. The key idea is that each triplet of cells (left, current, right) forms a 3-bit binary number, which is used to determine the next state of the current cell according to a rule. The rule outcomes are determined by the binary conversion of the rule number such that the possible outcomes in a state change table (read top to bottom) stem from the binary digits of the 8-bit binary representation (read left to right). The 8-bit binary representation of the rule number allows for eight possible outcomes and also restricts rule numbers to be within 2^8 [0, 255]. The rule is essentially a lookup table that specifies the next state of the current cell based on the triplet. The algorithm determines the next state of the current cell by looking at the triplet with its neighbors and using the rule table to map that triplet to a new state. <br> <br> 
          For example, here is the state change table for rule 30: <br> 
          If the left cell is 1, the current cell is 1, and the right cell is 1 (111), the next state of the current cell is 0. <br>
          If the left cell is 1, the current cell is 1, and the right cell is 0 (110), the next state of the current cell is 0. <br>
          If the left cell is 1, the current cell is 0, and the right cell is 1 (101), the next state of the current cell is 0. <br>
          If the left cell is 1, the current cell is 0, and the right cell is 0 (100), the next state of the current cell is 1. <br>
          If the left cell is 0, the current cell is 1, and the right cell is 1 (011), the next state of the current cell is 1. <br>
          If the left cell is 0, the current cell is 1, and the right cell is 0 (010), the next state of the current cell is 1. <br>
          If the left cell is 0, the current cell is 0, and the right cell is 1 (001), the next state of the current cell is 1. <br>
          If the left cell is 0, the current cell is 0, and the right cell is 0 (000), the next state of the current cell is 0. <br> 
          <i> *Notice that this example uses rule 30, which has an 8-bit binary number of 00011110. The binary number from left to right is the output of the state table above, read top down. This is the case for all possible rule numbers 0 - 255, as the 8-bit binary representation of the rule number determines the state change table output. </i> <br> <br>
          The algorithm follows the steps: <br>
          1. Initialize the lattice with an initial configuration. <br>
          2. For each time step and cell in the lattice, identify the left neighbor, the current cell, and the right neighbor, form the triplet and convert it to a binary number, then use the rule table to determine the next state of the current cell. <br>
          3. Update the lattice synchronously (all cells are updated simutaneously after each time step) for parallel simulation or asynchronously (cells are updated sequentially in a particular order after each time step) for sequential simulation. <br>
          4. Repeat for the desired number of time steps (iteration amount). <br> <br>
          For parallel simulation (synchronous updating), all the cells in the lattice are updated at the same time based on the current state of the system. This means that the next state for each cell is computed based on the neighbors' values before any updates happen. All cells are updated simultaneously in a single time step. For sequential simulation (asynchronous updating), the cells are updated one at a time in some configured sequence. This means that by the time a given cell is updated, some of its neighbors might have already been updated, while others have not. The next state of each cell is computed based on the most recent available states of its neighbors, which could include updated cells.

For a current time step, the cell and its direct neighbors are taken in as a binary representation (Dead - White - 0, Alive - Black - 1). The three binary numbers are read left to right and converted to decimal, and the decimal value (range [0,7]) corresponds to an index in the reversed binary number. The value at the given index is the new state of the cell. The rule is applied as a parallel update, meaning every cell in the lattice is updated simutaneously upon each iteration.

        <div class="p3"> 
          The Game of Life is represented on a 2D grid where each cell has eight neighbors (top, bottom, left, right, and the four diagonals). A cell on the grid can either be dead (0) or alive (1), and the state of the cells change over discrete time steps according to the states of neighboring cells. Specifically, the state of each cell at the next time step is determined by its current state of the cell and the number of alive neighbors. <br> <br>
          The algorithm Update Rules: <br>
          1. Underpopulation: A living cell with fewer than 2 alive neighbors dies (due to loneliness). <br>
          2. Survival: A living cell with 2 or 3 alive neighbors remains alive (survival). <br>
          3. Overpopulation: A living cell with more than 3 alive neighbors dies (due to overcrowding). <br>
          4. Reproduction: A dead cell with exactly 3 alive neighbors becomes a live cell (a new cell is born). <br> <br>
          The algorithm follows the steps: <br>
          1. Initialize: Set up the grid with some configuration: some cells marked as alive (1) and others as dead (0). <br>
          2. Count Neighbors: For each cell, count the number of live neighbors in its neighborhood grid (eight neighbors). <br>
          3. Apply Rules: For each cell, apply the rules to determine whether the cell will be alive or dead in the next time step. <br>
          4. Update Grid: Update the grid to reflect the new states after applying the rules. <br>
          5. Repeat: Continue iterating for multiple time steps to observe how the patterns evolve. <br> <br>
          For example, consider a 3x3 grid with the initial configuration [(0,1,0), (0,1,0), (0,1,0)] (Flattened 2D array.) <br>
          In this case, cells (1,0), (1,1), and (1,2) are alive (1), and the rest are dead (0). <br> <br>
          Results after algorithm application: <br>
          Cell (0,0): Dead (0), with 2 alive neighbors (0,1) and (1,0). It remains dead. <br>
          Cell (0,1): Alive (1), with 1 alive neighbor (1,1). It dies due to underpopulation. <br>
          Cell (0,2): Dead (0), with 2 alive neighbors (0,1) and (1,2). It remains dead. <br>
          Cell (1,0): Alive (1), with 1 alive neighbor (1,1). It dies due to underpopulation. <br>
          Cell (1,1): Alive (1), with 2 alive neighbors (1,0) and (1,2). It survives. <br>
          Cell (1,2): Alive (1), with 1 alive neighbor (1,1). It dies due to underpopulation. <br>
          Cell (2,0): Dead (0), with 2 alive neighbors (1,0) and (2,1). It remains dead. <br>
          Cell (2,1): Alive (1), with 2 alive neighbors (1,1) and (2,0). It survives. <br>
          Cell (2,2): Dead (0), with 2 alive neighbors (1,2) and (2,1). It remains dead. <br> <br>
          Updated grid after one iteration: [(0,0,0), (1,1,1), (0,0,0)]. <br>
          In this case, cells (0,1), (1,1), and (2,1) are alive (1), and the rest are dead (0). <br>
          In this new state, a horizontal line of living cells has formed, showing the transformation from a vertical line of alive cells to a horizontal line after one iteration.
