          <u>Iteration Input Box</u>: Enter the number of iterations to complete. Manipulating the iteration amount will change emerging patterns by limiting or expanding the application of a rule. The iteration amount is inclusive such that it goes the entered number of iterations beyond the starting iteration (starting state, index = 0). Using the "Start" or "Iterate" buttons will simulate up to the entered iteration amount.

        <div class="p3">
          <u>Rule Input Box</u>: Enter a rule number to determine the behavior of the cellular automaton. The rule number encodes the transition rules for each cell based on its neighborhood configuration. Upon input, the rule numbers are converted into eight digit binary numbers, then the binary number is reversed and indexed. For a current timestep, the cell and its direct neighbors are taken in as a binary representation (Dead - White - 0, Alive - Black - 1). The three binary numbers are read left to right and converted to decimal, and the decimal value (range [0,7]) corresponds to an index in the reversed binary number. The value at the given index is the new state of the cell. The rule is applied as a parallel update, meaning every cell in the lattice is updated simutaneously upon each iteration.

Manipulating the lattice size will impact the complexity of the system as it will change the interactions and possibilities for emergent patterns and may impact the affects of the boundary condition. The size of the individual cells will decrease as the lattice size increases to fit the lattice in the canvas region.

        <div class="p3"> 
          <u>Infinite</u>: The lattice is conceptually, and in this simulation, visibly extended infinitely in horizontal direction. Upon iteration, the lattice expands to the left and right side in order to simulate an infinitely sized lattice, as in, a lattice with infinite dead cells (white, 0). Since a cells state depends on its left and right neighbor, the infinite simulation expands on the edges per iteration so that the edge cells always have a left and right neighbor.
        </div>
        <div class="p4"> 
          <i> Warning: </i> Large lattice sizes and iteration amounts may result in performance issues (simulation delay) upon iteration.
        </div>
        <div class="p3"> 
          <u>Finite</u>: The lattice has a fixed size such that the cells at the edges of the lattice do not have neighbors beyond the boundaries. Therefore, there must be a method to handle the edge cells such as a periodic or null boundary conditions. 
        </div>
        <div class="p4"> 
          <i> Periodic: </i> The lattice is treated as if it were wrapped around, forming a torus-like shape. When a cell reaches the edge of the lattice, its neighbors on the opposite side of the lattice are considered as its direct neighbors. This creates a seamless continuity in the behavior as if the lattice repeats itself indefinitely. <br>
          <i> Null: </i> Imposes a fixed value zero for cells beyond the edges of the lattice. Thus, every edge cell with an out of bounds neighbor considers the neighbor to be dead (white, 0) and will use it in the next cell state calculation. This effectively creates a "wall" at the edges of the lattice.

The currently stored values for "Iterations," "Rule," and "Lattice" will remain, as they are not impacted by the clear event. Upon Iteration beyond the starting lattice, the "Clear" button is converted to a "Reset" button. Click the "Reset" button to clear all iterations, except for the starting lattice. Thus, the simulation is cleared but the state of the initial starting lattice remains, acting as a simulation reset. Clicking the "Reset" button will convert it back to a "Clear" button.

        <div class="p3"> 
          <u>General Description</u>: The canvas is the gray region enclosed by a black border below the primary and secondary toolbars. It has a fixed width and a dynamic height. Changing the lattice size will not impact the width of the canvas. Rather, cells will be added until they reach the edge of the canvas, then the cells will be evenly resized to fit the fixed canvas width. As for the height, the canvas will dynamically extend downard as space is needed (as iterations occur). Upon using the "Iterate" button, the canvas will seemingly expand and simulate in the same instance, but using the "Start" will show a slower expansion prioir to the simulation. 
        </div>
        <div class="p3"> 
          <u>Cell State Toggle</u>: Inside the canvas, clicking cells will toggle them between dead (white, 0) and alive (balck, 1) states to set a starting position (index = 0) for the simulation. Only the starting state cells can be toggled. Cells can be toggled even if a simulation has already completed; clicking "Start" or "Iterate" will overwrite the canvas. Cell borders will automatically be removed on the starting lattice for lattice sizes over 200.
        </div>
        <div class="p3"> 
          <u>Starting Lattice Zoom</u>: Inside the canvas, using the scroll wheel on a mouse will zoom on a specified location. The x-axis mouse location determines the horizontal zoom focus and the y-axis mouse location determines the vertical zoom focus. When only the starting iteration is present on the canvas (index = 0), the y-axis mouse location has no impact on the zoom focus location; the vertical zoom focus, in this case, will always be on the starting lattice in the canvas. Scroll up to zoom in and scroll down to zoom out. The maximum outward zoom is set to the defaulted (standard - 100%) zoom factor for the canvas.  
        </div>
        <div class="p4">

          <u>About Button</u>: Click "About" to open an overlaying window to describe the simulator. The window contains information about the background of Wolfram's Nearest Neighbor 1D, the purpose of its use and study, and a summary of its application. The window may be longer than the page, so a vertical scroll bar will be available to navigate the entire window. The window may be closed by clicking the "x" at the top right of the window or clicking anywhere outside the windows borders.

          <u>Zoom Slider</u>: Click and hold the slider labeled "Delay" to alter the delay time (ms) between iterations when using the "Start" button. Alternatively, click the slider and use the left and right arrow keys to change the delay value. Larger delays may be useful in analysing the transitions between iterations. Smaller delays, even a delay value of 0 ms, will not be immediate like the "Iterate" button, although it will generate very fast.
